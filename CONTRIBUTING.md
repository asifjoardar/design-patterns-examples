## Project Structure

This project is modular-based, and each design pattern has its own module. Here is the structure:

```
pattern-name/
  â”œâ”€â”€ example1/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/
  â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml
  â”œâ”€â”€ pom.xml
pom.xml
```

### Key Points:

- **`pattern-name`**: Represents a design pattern (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
- **`example1`**: Contains the examples code and a `pom.xml` for a specific implementation of the pattern.
